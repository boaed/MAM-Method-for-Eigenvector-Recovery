# MAM Method for Eigenvector Recovery

This repository contains all the necessary files to reproduce the experiments related to the MAM method for eigenvector recovery.

## Files

- `primes.txt`: A list of prime numbers less than 10,000. This file is required for constructing the $(K, \alpha)$-coherent matrix **M**.
- `Experiment_varying_rank.py`: A python script needed for the experiments showing how the errors before and after recovery are affected by the rank of the original matrix **A**
## Usage

Instructions on how to run the experiments will go here.
